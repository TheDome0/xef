He tried it because his face gets chapped and red from working outside. It actually helped by about 60%! I love it cuz it’s lightweight and smells so yummy! After applying makeup, it doesn’t leave streaks like other moisturizers cause. i would definitely use this!\\n- Review 5 (rated 5): I’ve been using this for 10+yrs now. I don’t have any noticeable wrinkles at all. I use Estée Lauder’s micro essence then advance repair serum before I apply this lotion. A little goes a long way! It does feel greasier than most face lotions that I’ve tried previously but I don’t apply much. I enjoy cucumber like scent of the face lotion. I have combination skin and never broke out using this. This is my daily skincare product with or without makeup. And it has SPF but I also apply Kravebeauty SPF on top as well for extra protection")
